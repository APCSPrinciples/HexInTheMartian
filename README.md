# Hexadecimal in the Martian
Watch the [pathfinder scene from the martian movie](https://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/100000003950701/anatomy-of-a-scene-the-martian.html). Having successfully used Pathfinder to contact earth, Matt Damon’s character realizes he needs a better system than just `Yes` or `No`. Starting at 49’ 20” in the movie, Matt Damon's character discusses the Hexadecimal and ASCII systems. I wasn't able to find the whole scene, but you can watch [part of the hexadecimal scene from The Martian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffB0Je-xjKg).
